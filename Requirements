Create Kubernetes cluster in Azure, using Pulumi or Terraform:
1.	Setup K8s cluster with the latest stable version, with RBAC enabled.
2.	The Cluster should have 2 services deployed â€“ Service A and Service B:
a.	Service A is a WebServer written in C# or Go that exposes the following:
i.	Current value of Bitcoin in USD (updated every 10 seconds taken from an API on the web).
ii.	Average value over the last 10 minutes.
b.	Service B is a REST API service, which exposes a single controller that responds 200 status code on GET requests.
3.	Cluster should have NGINX Ingress controller deployed, and corresponding ingress rules for Service A and Service B.
4.	Service A should not be able to communicate with Service B.
